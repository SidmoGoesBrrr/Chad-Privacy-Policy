# What is Chad?
Chad is a rich and multipurpose aesthetically pleasing bot. With our games, moderation, utility, fun commands, and so much more, you can dexterously
increase your server's activity while also enforcing rules and punishing users that deserve it.. If you would like more information on how the bot started or any information regarding the bot in general, please join our [support server](https://discord.gg/wTsj4DZhyZ). The bot is running on a private VPS [Vitrual Private Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server). So it usually runs 24/7 unless I'm fixing bugs, adding updates (which are always scheduled), or switching to a different server via the VPS. This bot is **kid-friendly** and is mainly used for communities of the aesthetic tone.
